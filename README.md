DrunkFriend
===========

Android application to help facilitate getting a ride when you're drunk. Can be found in the Google Play Market as Drunk Friend (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.austindiviness.drunkfriend)

The app starts off by loading the Home activity, where the user can choose between viewing a list of all contacts on the phone (AllContactsActivity), or seeing just those that they have set to "speed dial" (FavoritesActivity). From there, they can choose who to contact to come pick them up. GPS data will be gathered and formatted into a Google Maps URL and sent to the chosen contact along with a predefined message explaining the situation.
